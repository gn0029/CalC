## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

**Fork and clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CalC.git
cd CalC
```

## üîÑ GitHub Flow

We follow the GitHub Flow for contributions. Here's the proper workflow:

### 1. Fork the Repository

- **Go to the main repository** on GitHub
- **Click the "Fork" button** in the top-right corner
- **This creates your own copy** of the repository under your GitHub account

### 2. Clone Your Fork

- **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CalC.git
  cd CalC
  ```
- **Add the original repository as upstream**
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/gn0029/CalC.git
  ```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

- **Create a new branch** from `main` for your feature or fix
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/add-emoji-support` or `fix/login-bug`

### 4. Make Your Changes

- **Edit files** and implement your feature or fix
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

### 5. Pull Latest Changes from Upstream

- **Before committing, sync with the original repository**
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git pull upstream main
  ```
- **Resolve any merge conflicts** if they occur
- This ensures your changes are based on the latest code

### 6. Add and Commit Your Changes

- **Stage your changes**
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
- **Commit with a descriptive message**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat: add emoji support to chat messages"
  ```

### 7. Push to Your Fork

- **Push your branch** to your forked repository
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### 8. Open a Pull Request

- **Go to your fork** on GitHub
- **Click "Compare & pull request"** button
- **Fill in the PR details:**
  - Provide a clear description of your changes
  - Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
  - Add screenshots or videos for UI changes

### 9. Respond to Feedback

- **Review comments** from maintainers
- **Make requested changes** in your local branch
- **Commit and push updates** to the same branch
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- The PR will update automatically

### 10. After Merge

- **Pull the latest changes** to your local main branch
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull upstream main
  ```
- **Delete your feature branch** (optional cleanup)
  ```bash
  git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
  git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
  ```
